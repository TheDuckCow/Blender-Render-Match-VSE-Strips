# Blender Render Match VSE Strips
This operator helps setup something I do very often: it takes the currently active sequence in blender and sets the render to match its resolution and length (length is based on all selected sequences, resolution is based on just the active sequence).

# Blender Show/Hide/Toggle strip modifiers
This operator quickly allows you to show, hide, or toggle all modifiers of selected strips. See demo below. Note: future goal (but not currently implemented) is to make toggle, or show/hide save "initial state". Meaning: if you select hide, it hides everything, but if you then select show it will only show the modifiers that were initially not muted in the first place.
